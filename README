Presentation
============

ExpatSML is a Standard ML wrapper for the expat library
(http://www.libexpat.org), using MLton foreign intefaces (FFIs). As such, only
this compiler is supported. It has been tested with the latest version available
of expat: 2.0.1.

Lacking features
================

Not all functions are available. An unavailable function falls in one of the
following category:

- We didn't have any interest in it. However, we can add it upon request
  (provided it's not a function described in the following part).

- Not all Standard ML data can pass between C and Standard ML with the MLton
  FFis. For instance, 'XML_SetUserData' and its sibling 'XML_GetUserData' cannot
  be exported. Thus, user data must be held in global variables.

- C memory management functions. We obviously do not want to see those in
  Standard ML.

Also, there is actually no Unicode support in the way that you can parse files
which are encoded with UTF-8, provided they contain only ASCII characters.

Using ExpatSML
==============

All available functions are described in the EXPAT signature. Their names match
exactly those of the expat library, the 'XML_' prefix being stripped.
